## Created by Nouf Faez Al Mutairi

This repository contains projects i did for the Programming For Data Science With Python Nanodegree program from Udacity in collaberation  with Saudi Digital Academy SDA RISE  Program.

## Project 1 :
[Check My Project Submission Through This Link](https://github.com/nouf-falmutairi/Programming-for-Data-Science-Nanodegree-Rise-Program/tree/master/Project1-SQL)

### Overview:

This project consisted in the exploration of a provided database movie rentals in which the student had to run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of the student's queries. 

For the presentation component, the student had to create four slides, and each should have 
* A question of interest.
* A supporting visualization created using the final data of the SQL queries that answer the questions of interest.
* A small summary on each slide.


## Project 2 :
[Check My Project Submission Through This Link](https://github.com/nouf-falmutairi/Programming-for-Data-Science-Nanodegree-Rise-Program/tree/master/Project%202-%20Python)

### Overview:

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able to filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to present statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to choose to view raw data.


## Project 3 :

### Overview:

This project used Git and GitHub with a simulated workflow to refactor Project 2.

The Project Submission consisted in the filling of a template with all the Git commands used to perform the requested tasks.
